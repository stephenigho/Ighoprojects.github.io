									<h2><a href="#">Unilever Canteen Ordering System</a></h2>
									<p>Unilever is a British-Dutch FMCG company, headquartered in London, England. Unilever is one of the oldest
										FMCG companies, and its products are available in around 190 countries.
										In its UK offices, Unilever has around 1500 employees which are spread across 12 floors. They have 2 canteens
										to cater to these 1500 employees. Each canteen can seat around 150 employees at a time. This was a very unique project as it involed two canteens, manually catering to about 1500 staff, leading at least 35min on queues, food wastage, loss of productivity, staff dissatisfaction. 
										So we recommended an automated ordering system to be developed to address the problems, which lead to a decrease in food waste by 30%. 
									It also resulted in improved staff satisfaction.</p>
